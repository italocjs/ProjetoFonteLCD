# Simple PSU with a Screen

Very simple program to control a PSU; it read three voltages (through an voltage divider) and displays it on the screen, which can enable or disable the separated outputs (5, 12 and VREF).
Not maintaned in several years, could be used as an idea, but its not efficient and the screen used is extremely outdated (1.5" if i'm not mistaken)
